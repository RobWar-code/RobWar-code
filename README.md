Welcome to RobWar-code
I have two uses currently for this account:
  1) Example webpages arising from my Diploma in Full-Stack Development
  2) The xbwlteam organisation, in which myself and others issue changes to
    the PC programming language XBasic for Windows and Linux
    
I currently have 5 years experience working in Javascript, HTML and CSS
1 1/2 years working in PHP and MySql
This has all been work on my own projects see: narayana-art.co.uk
In addition I have 5 years experience working in XBasic and am familiar with C.
Most of my work is done on Linux systems, so I have good familiarity with this as well.
